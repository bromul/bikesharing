# NYC Citibike Analysis

## Overview

This is a statistical analysis of New York City's Citibike Program to determine its economic viability for Des Moines, Iowa.

### Purpose

After visiting New York City, we found that one of the most enjoyable aspects of the trip was our ability to quickly maneuver around the city using Citibikes. We seek to bring this program to Des Moines and so have conducted this statistical analysis of New York's Citibike Program to quell investor worries and ensure the success of a Citibike business in our hometown.


## Results

### Top Starting Locations

As seen above, the majority of bike trips are started in the south of Manhattan. However, once we move further south, east, or north of this area, the number of Citibike rides started begins to taper off. This suggests that most rides are begun within the city center, which should be focused on in our expansion to Des Moines. 


### Gender Breakdown

We see that males make up the vast majority of Citibike users, accounting for almost 3/4 of all users. In our efforts to bring a Citibike program to Des Moines, we may want to focus on reaching out to other genders and decrease the gender disparity.


### Checkout Times for Users

We found that most people use Citibike for less than an hour, with most rides only lasting about 5 minutes. This suggests that Citibike users are seeking quick transportation between locations rather than exercise or scenic views. These numbers may be skewed right compared to Des Moines due to New York's density. If Citibike charges per minute of use, we may have to adjust prices downwards to accomodate Des Moines' relative spread.


### Checkout Times by Gender
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1624216037094' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Checkout Times by Gender ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;NY&#47;NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16241343236940&#47;CheckoutTimesbyGender&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16241343236940&#47;CheckoutTimesbyGender' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;NY&#47;NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16241343236940&#47;CheckoutTimesbyGender&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>          

We see the same trend with trip duration when the data is broken down by gender, with most trips lasting less than 1 hour and the majority of those lasting around 5 minutes. As expected from our earlier gender breakdown, males make up the lion's share of users.


### Trips by Weekday per Hour

Use-trends of Citibike in New York City changes depending on if it's the weekend or a weekday.

During the week, Citibike use first peaks from 6am to 9am, and again from 4pm to 8pm. This could be indicative of tourists riding to a district in the morning, using other forms of transportation during the day (walking, taxis, buses, metro, etc.), and then riding back after the day. Alternatively, due the the specific times, this could represent locals taking Citibike to and from work.

On the weekends (Saturday and Sunday), however, this trend changes. Rather than peaking in the mornings and evenings, Citibike use stays relatively consistent between 9am and 8pm. This lends credence to the idea that Citibike is often used by locals, as these would be days that many people are off of work and have the time to use Citibikes.


### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1624216158240' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;NY&#47;NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16241343236940&#47;TripsbyGenderWeekdayperHour&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16241343236940&#47;TripsbyGenderWeekdayperHour' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;NY&#47;NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16241343236940&#47;TripsbyGenderWeekdayperHour&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>

When broken down by gender, these trends remain similar and we, again, see males dominate Citibike usage throughout the week.


### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

We found that Citibike is more heavily utilized during the week, rather than on weekends, meaning the majority of Citibike rides in New York City are during those hours in the mornings and evenings Monday-Friday. Interestingly, the vast majority of Citibike users are subscribers, _not_ individual customers. Since we would expect most tourists to be customers instead of subscribers, this suggests that most Citibike users are in fact _locals_.



## Summary

### Findings

From our analyses, we can come to a few likely conclusions about Citibike services in New York City:
- Males use Citibike more often than other genders
- Citibike is most often utilized in denser, downtown locales
- Mornings and Evenings on Monday-Friday are the most active times for Citibike
- Subscribers make up the vast majority of the consumer base
- Trips on Citibike are shorter on average (~5 minutes), rather than longer (e.g. 1+ hours)

Therefore, when taken together, we feel justified in making certain assumptions about the Citibike consumer base in New York City. Specifically, our analyses lead us to believe that the average Citibike user in New York City is a working male who mainly uses these services to during the week to travel to and from their work. 


This has multiple implications for our business model as we seek to expand similar services to Des Moines:
- Outreach to people of genders other than male can help lower our potential gender disparity and increase are future customer base
- Expansion efforts should be focused on the downtoun Des Moines area
- Since New York City's consumer base is vastly subscription-based, our revenue model should not be greatly impacted by Des Moines tourism
- As such, our marketing should demonstrate how our services can ease transportation for _locals_ in the area


### Further Analysis

As we work to bring bike-based services to the Des Moines area, we will continue our analyses on the New York City Citibike data to guide our efforts. Future analyses may include:
- Geographic density of the Manhattan area with regard to User Type. Here we are using User Type as a proxy for customer locality, i.e., whether they are a tourist or local. This would give us greater confirmation of the reasons customers use Citibike within specific areas, e.g. whether certain areas are more heavily used by tourists or locals.
- In a similar vein, by mapping out Starting and Ending Locations, we could determine if certain Citibike locations are being more heavily utilized than others. This could then act as a springboard for further investigation into what's in the area (offices, landmarks, etc.) and could help with planning the distribution of Citibike-style services in Des Moines.
- Further, deeper analysis into individual bike use, that is calculating relative lengths of rides using Starting and Ending Locations along with the Trip Durations and Bike Ids, could give us more acute insight into bike depreciation and, ultimately, the general cost of repairs.
